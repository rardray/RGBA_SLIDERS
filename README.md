## Front end creation of various control UI using Create React App and Css

The purpose of this exercise was to:
```
- Utulize ES6 native functions such as boundingClient (rather than using JQuery) to obtain DOM values to:
  - manipulate CSS values in real time
  - calculate useful values from relative coordinates to change values of other elements. 
    Values that could have practical applications (rgb values(255) volume as % as well as midi values and DBS representation).
``` 
- AS ALWAYS refactoring code, making components as reusable as possible.
```
- Keeping state at top level
```
- Making use of local to storage to maintain UI settings.

# Plans for improvement
```
- Removing CSS and using JSX for styling
```
- Improving on code reuse by generating state keys rather than declaring at top level.
```
- Applying UI to control actual media types.
```
After doing a few full stack excersices incorperating RESTful API, I wanted to take a break and try building UI that would involve more mathematics.  Something more complex than just clicking links adding posts etc etc.
